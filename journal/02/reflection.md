# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
    JavaScript is thankfully fairly similar to GML, So I've had a pretty good time learning the differences.

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
    Websites do not function with a step system that I'm used to, Therefor adjusting to the call once and only once method has been hard to adjust to.

- What are you struggling with?
    With JavaScript the call once method, I have really struggled with setInterval(*code*, xInterval), I couldnt reach into setInterval and freely change xInterval. I guess its being called once and set up once so it technically doesnt loop back to its beginning it just keeps marching on.

- What would you count as a victory?
    My checkpoint... I havent recieved my grade but I worked really hard. I think I worked pretty smart and I hope I've done really well. I'm proud that a lot of this has been some sort of review. I am both intimidated and excited that I dont recognize any of the words in this weeks questions.
