# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
    I feel like its all gone well so far, I'm a little nervous because I haven't found anything particularly challenging.
    I have really enjoyed the media brakes
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
    All of the Html is brand new to me, It has been really surprising how different languages are geared toward different things. Html is obviouse really good for page layouts, whereas something like GML is better for switching out and updating multiple elements.
    * a lot of keyboard commands are universal and thats super cool.
- What are you struggling with?
    I am struggling the most with display flex and manipulating images, There hasnt been anything that has really clicked so far. Display flex makes more sense but its still a guess and check. Manipulating images is even more so guess and check.
- What would you count as a victory?
    Participating, I have asked some questions and was able to submit moody kittens, I was so worried, distraught about having done all that work and not following through due to my own limitations of knowledge and experience. The team at Codeworks helped though, they helped me fix a rather large issue I created for myself and I was able to submit, get credit and get the discount. I wouldnt be able to say that if I hadnt asked for help.
