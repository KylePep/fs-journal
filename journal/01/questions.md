# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > We use github as a way to centralize the location of code projects, for colaberation, backups and tracking.

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > Make directory

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > Things like :hover :focus, :hover especially as it tracks users mouse movement and can help interact with the webpage.

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > Specificity is the hierarchy of classification, Higher specificity means it will outlast lowers and showup in the porduct. Meaning you can use it to cover narrower and narrower criteria

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > It may become difficult to track what is !important and if you need to undo it you may have serious specification issues because it had covered them up.


06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > Selector, Property and Value

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > Accessiblity is an aspect of design that enables people who need it to interact with it in the first place and helps others who may not strictly need it. Calls to action can be done with the position of elements and color choice, this could drive a user to make a purchase or help them find the log in button.

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > the purpose of wireframing is to build a blueprint of the website program or app in order to describe function and assign placeholders to elements.

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > Yes, Wireframing is essential, when you are staring at lines of code it can feel hopeless unless you have some kind of grander plan. It helps you implement how things should work together, elevates the blank page feeling.

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    >display: flex if a function that gives you the abiltiy to organize the elements in a container, display: property 

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    <!-- > NOTE working answer-->
    things like padding and margins will effect the size of the box model.
