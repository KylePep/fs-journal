# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's
01. What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

  > asynchronous code has multiple threads that run in tandum, whereas synchronous code runs one operation at a time.

02. What is an event listener?

  > Helps uphold the s in solid, single responsibility and helps maintain securtiy
