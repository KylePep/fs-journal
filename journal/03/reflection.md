# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
  I feel I adapted to mvc as well as i could of, it is just a file structure, certain things go in certain places just like the rest of coding.
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
  The Mvc structure is a mess to get your head around at first, A lot of it is kind of these made up rules that you just need to keep track of which can be nerve racking, like I could do it this way but is that not in the spirit of mvc
- What are you struggling with?
  The memorization of some of the minute functions that are pretty repetetive.
- What would you count as a victory?
  Ducking the week 3 checkpoint, I knew I could do it. I believe I have patience for myself to learn and trust in myself to sift through all of my resources until I find an answer.
