# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
Vue was easier than anticipated, The slotting of components is pretty straight forward and the ability to organize that way is extremely helpful.
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
Its really a shame that things like Vue come and go so quickly. They are extremely helpful, I guess there just isnt a one size fits all.
- What are you struggling with?
I stuggled with the energy levels, On friday I found myself out of steam and made stupid mistakes. The html of it all is still pretty worrying. hrefs and router-links feel pretty complicated.
- What would you count as a victory?
Ducked the checkpoint again, Made something I'm fairly proud of, it isn't super pretty but it is very obvious that is passes the requirements.
