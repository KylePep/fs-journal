Bootstrap has many utility classes to help make forms etc. Bootstrap is a utility and generally has prebuilt code to execute most CSS functions like
margin
mx-6- this will do margin along the x-axis

Bootstrap grid system, helps elements stack. desktop - phone
~twitter used bootstrap, was made open source~ 
*Good documentation*  

Bootstrap: Grid system
  Container 
    Rows stretch across horizontally -------- (Rows by default) a row can contain 12 positions
    Column (col1), they can contain html (these columns can be 1-12, and take up relevant space)
  -using external style sheet- 
    ex (class= "row", class= "col") bootstrap will know what to do

Google Dev tools may struggle with already added bootstrap. If it isnt moving see if there is a bootstrap already in place preventing the testing

there is an inspect function to toggle mobile mode

Breakpoints will tell the column system when to be the different setting, column size etc. breakpoints are often in the middle of the class

Bootstrap has button classes class= "btn btn-(XYZ)"
